# Coin-Calculator and currency converter
A calculator! How fun! Intended for people like me who don't want to use their brains. Use it to calculate how many coins ya got!

Also a currency converter! Currently supports converting between USD, CAD and EUR. More may be added soon.

# Dependencies:
FreeSimpleGUI, https://github.com/spyoungtech/FreeSimpleGUI

# Disclaimer!!
The converter may not be 100% accurate! The conversion rates are based off of what the data from exchange-rates.org said at the time of coding the application, (2025/10/04). Use this ONLY to get a general gist of what different currencies are like. if you need something more accurate, a web search will server you better :)
